Just make sure to have python installed and the script will create a file with links that can be used in and org-mode file for autocompletion of links when making notes about your Path of Exile builds.
Just add #+SETUPFILE: PoELinkList at the top of your org file to use the link list after running the script.
The template folder also contains a very simple org-capture template for use when creating a fresh build for easier note taking.
Only works with skills for now, will add the rest later.

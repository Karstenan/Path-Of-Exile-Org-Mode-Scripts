Just make sure to have python installed and the script will create a file with links that can be used in and org-mode file for autocompletion of links when making notes about your Path of Exile builds. Also after having installed python run "pip install requests" to install the needed requests module.
Just add #+SETUPFILE: poeOrgResources at the top of your org file to use the link list after running the script.
The template folder also contains a very simple org-capture template for use when creating a fresh build for easier note taking.
Only works with skills for now, will add the rest later.
